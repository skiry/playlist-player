<h1> Youtube playlist player </h1>
<p>An executable program written in C and C++ which opens a local file that contains a youtube link on each line and randomly opens one of the links, sleeps until it is finished and then plays another one randomly. Useful if one does not have / want a youtube account or already has a playlist but does not stay logged in all the time. Just copy the link into your file and that's it.</p>
<p>The time to sleep is determined by parsing the song's source file.</p>
